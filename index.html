            six children and went from St Peter and St johns primary
            school to St Ambrose Barlow RC high school then Loreto college until finally i graduated from Salford
            university with a first class honers
            degree in mathematics in 2015. I Worked at Argos, Salford Regents road, from 2012 till 2018 where i was the
            stockroom team leader. I started
            learning with Code Nation early March 2019.

            told me all about the courses available and the work he
            had been doing. This sounded great to me so i decided to find out more about it and I applied to joint the
            three week web development course
            to get a idea for myself about what it was like and see if i wanted to join the master course myself.</p>

        <p class="para" id="para2">I've been interested in technology for as long as i can remember from using games
            consoles like the Gameboy as a child and wondering
            how it all worked, and this interest was increased by a friend of mine who did a masters degree in Computer
            Science (MComp),
            talking with him about his degree and the work he did always fascinated me and made coding something i
            wanted to learn especially
            when he showed me the native app he made called 'My Pocket Galaxy', available on iPhone and android.</p>

                    about a company after business hours. These things can create a stronger public image for busnesses.

            </li>
            <li>
                <p> Technology can make businesses more efficient by automising certain processes and allows things such
                    as meetings over the
                    internet instead of company headquarters.</p>

                    GitHub is incredibly useful for collaborative work as it has a version control software so any

                    may have made changes and when, it also allows the recovery of previous states of work. This means
                    that should anything go wrong with any
                    of the code, we can see who made changes and inquire with them as to what may have gone wrong and
                    even recover the code from before these
                    changes were made if necessary.

            General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR has been implemented across Europe into privacy laws, and applies
            to all companies storing personal
            information about European citizens. This gives people more control over thier personal data and how it is
            stored. Personal data in these laws
            applies to any information related to a person, such as; their name, photos, email address and bank details
            etc. This has impacted a lot on
            companies such how sales and marketing teams operate, and lead to things such new forms and applications for
            customers to be compliant with
            things such as double opt-in rules and email marketing practices. this requires customers who sign up to

            Copyright stops other people using your work without their permission and pretending like its their own.
            Copyright protection is gained
            automatically when you create any original work such as, any written work or photography, software or web
            content, music or film recordings etc.
            you don't need to apply and there is no register of copyright works in the UK. In most countries copyright
            lasts a minimum of life plus fifty years
            for most types of work and prevents people copying your work, giving out copies of it (either free of for
            sale), making adations of your work or
            performing/showing your work in public.

            Websites have to take into account the needs of all users to create an inclusive environment, people with

            People that are colour blind could
            require the site to not use particular colour combinations so that they can view everthing correctly, and
            people with dyslexia would need
            the use of particular fonts to make the content easier to read. These are just a few of the issues that are

                    The tools i used to create my website were mainly Visual Studio Code
                    and Trello, I am happy with the use of these tools as Trello allowed
                    me to plan out my website and keep track of all my tasks. Visual Studio
                    Code was easy to use and let me link my information html to my css styling.
                    These tools were appropriate as they allowed me to work quickly and efficiently
                    to complete this project with minimal issues.

                    Overall I am happy with the outcome of my website as it fits the criteria set at the start
                    of the project and matches the purpose and requirements of the project. I have used a variaty of
                    techniques to create and stly my
                    website in html and css. Looking back over the project with hindsight I would
                    have layed out my wedsite a little differently, using the skills i have learned
                    during this project, if i was to do it again I would have added multiple pages
                    and changed how you navigate around the site. I would also change the website
                    visually with a better colour scheme for a more pleasing aesthetic. I could also
                    add these things when improving the website in the future.

                <p>
                    To improve efficiency and productivity during this project i could have used Trello more efficiently
                    and created a more detailed plan for my website at the start detailing how i wanted it to look and
                    work
                    as at the start i just detailed all the information i wanted the website to have
                    without to much thought in how it was going to look and this meant i had to go back over
                    and edit a lot of the work so i could style it more efficiently. The work could have also
                    been done in teams, separating the tasks so each person could complete a part of the project
                    and bring it together with GitHub and communicate with each other through the use of slack.
                    To test digital solutions i would perform some peer testing by getting people to use my
                    website to check it works correctly and give feedback on anything they think could be improved.

                    The appropriate filetypes for websites are html and css, html (Hypertext Markup Language)
                    provides the structure for a page and allows you to create online documents with headings,
                    text, tables and photos, etc. Create hyperlinks and include spreadsheets and video/sound clips.
                    CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to create the visual layout of the page, including colours
                    and fonts and allows it to adapt how the page is presented to different types of devices for
                    large/small
                    screens etc. These file types are also used because they can be used on all browsers.
